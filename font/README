 Droid, version 3.1
--------------------

The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's Steve
Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts for its
Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and comfort on a
mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web browsers and for other
screen text. It consists of Droid Serif, Droid Sans and Droid Sans Mono.

The font family is available in the Android Git tree as TrueType-flavored
OpenType files licensed under the Apache License version 2.0.

This package provides support for Droid in LaTeX, including XeLaTeX and
LuaLaTeX. It includes the original OpenType fonts, as well as Type 1 versions,
converted for this package using FontForge for full support with LaTeX and
Dvips.

Notice that this package does not support the Droid Pro family sold by
Ascender. Notice also that the Noto font family is considered to be the
successor for Droid, with better Unicode coverage and more weights and shapes
available.

This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License, either version
1.3c or above, with the exception of the .ttf and .pfb files, released under the
Apache License version 2.0.
